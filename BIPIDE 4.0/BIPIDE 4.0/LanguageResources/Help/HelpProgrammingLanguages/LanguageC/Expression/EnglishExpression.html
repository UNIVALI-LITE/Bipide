        <h1>Expressions</h1>
        <div class="conteudo">
		<p> An expression in a programming language is a combination of explicit values​​, constants, variables, operators and functions that are interpreted according to the specific rules of precedence and of association for a particular programming language, which calculates and then produces a different value. This process, as with mathematical expressions, called evaluation. The value can be of various types, such as numeric, string, and logical. </p>
         <p> For Example, 2 + 3 is an arithmetic expression programming, which evaluates to 5. A variable is an expression because it denotes a value in memory, then y + 6 is an expression. An Example of a relational expression is 4! = 4, which evaluates false. </p>
