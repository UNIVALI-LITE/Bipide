            <p>A programming language is a standardized method for communicating instructions to a computer. It is a set of syntactic and semantic rules used to define a computer program. Allows a programmer to specify precisely which data on a computer will operate, how they will be stored or transmitted, and what actions should be taken under various circumstances.</p>
