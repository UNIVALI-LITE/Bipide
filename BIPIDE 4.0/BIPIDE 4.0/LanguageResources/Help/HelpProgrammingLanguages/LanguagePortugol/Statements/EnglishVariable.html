        <h1>Declaration of Variables</h1>
        <div class="conteudo">
			 <p> When we refer to the variable from the point of view of computer programming, we are dealing with a "memory region (the computer) previously identified whose purpose is to store the data or information of a program for a certain period of time" . </p>
             <p> The computer stores the data in these divisions, and each division is only possible to store a given and every time the computer store a data in one of these divisions, the data that was previously stored is deleted. The content can be changed, but only for a given time can be stored in that division. </p>
             <p> A variable consists of two basic elements:. types that a variable can store and its identifier, name given to the variable to enable their use </p>
             <p> where the variable is declared defines its scope. </p>
        </div>
