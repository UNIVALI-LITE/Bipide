			<h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>The BIP I was grounded in an RISC (Reduced Instruction-Ift Computer) architecture PIC microcontroller architecture. This processor is oriented accumulator and not own register bank as the processor MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages). All operations in BIP if I use the battery because it has only one registrar to perform data storage, with all require some arithmetic operations using operands placed in memory. (MORANDI et al. 2006).</p>
            <p>The architecture of the BIP I have a few addressing modes, and all instructions have the same format. The format of instruction consists of an operation code with the size of 5 bits and an operand size of 11 bits, totaling 16 bits of instruction. (MORANDI; RAABE; ZEFERINO, 2006).</p>

			<p>The registers that make up the architecture of the BIP I registrars are (i) PC (Program Counter) that points to the next instruction to be executed, (ii) IR (Instruction Register) that stores the instruction in execution: and (iii) ACC (Accumulator) that is used to store data during the execution of an Arithmetic operation or assignment. (MORANDI; RAABE; ZEFERINO, 2006).</p>
			<p>The instruction set of BIP I comprises eight instruction being an instruction from Control three-four transfer instructions Arithmetic instructions. This instruction set can be seen below.</p>

			<h2>Organization</h2>
			<p>The BIP I have two specifications of organizing one using a Princeton-type structure, with a single memory for storing instruction data and other organization using the Harvard-type structure with separate instruction and data memories. (MORANDI et al. 2006). Despite having two different specifications, the most used is the structure Harvard, illustrated in the picture below.</p>
